Packages
========

When I fresh re-install my computer, I'm all the time googling a lot
to retrieve the name of the package I was missing.
I write all of them inside a .ini file and then I use my app to install them.

This app is only usable on debian-like operating systems (when apt is provided).
It's not intended to become an industrial software, but only to provide a few
functionalities.


Prelude
-------

pyqt4, dict4ini and python-apt are required.

    sudo apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools python-apt python-setuptools
    sudo easy_install dict4ini

Installation
------------

Download it and make sure the file qpackage/qpackage is executable :

    chmod +x qpackage/qpackage

The you need to compile the ui file :

    cd qpackage/
    pyuic4 main_window.ui -o main_window_ui.py

Then you can launch it :

    sudo ./qpackage/qpackage

Installation rights are needed to launch the application.
